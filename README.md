# Database-Management-Systems-2017
I developed this sample database project when i was in the first semester of the 3st grade at school in 2017.
I developed this small sample database for learn the database features (trigger ,function, view, relations ,sql queries etc.).
I studied on Postgre and Microsoft Sql Server databases. I wrote complex queries.
